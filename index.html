                    <p id="ctoppara">Lil Uzi Vert is an American rapper and songwriter who is best known for his chart-bursting single ‘Bad and Boujee’ that peaked at the number 1 position on the US Billboard Hot 100. Born as Symere Woods, Uzi’s venture into rapping began when he was in high school. Inspired by one of his friends, he took up rapping and ever since then, has solidified his spot as a natural entertainer. Such has been his fan following that he was tagged by media houses as one of the names to watch out for in the upcoming years, in 2016. His signature rapid delivery has been long praised and admired. Also the fact that he draws inspiration from not just a single source makes his music different. Uzi’s non conformity to Philadelphia’s long-held reputation for shotgun-mouthed, battle-ready MCs is a major plus point for him. Unlike other rappers, Uzi’s style is a mix of nasal vocal tone and melody. His rapping does not seem forced or the fact that he is trying to make a name for himself in a cypher by stuffing inordinate amount of syllables into a bar. Though Uzi’s musical journey began early, he gained fame when he came up with his third mixtape ‘Luv Is Rage’. He followed its success with his later mixtapes ‘Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World’ and ‘The Perfect Luv Tape’ both of which were released in 2016. Currently, he is one of the singing talents to watch out for in the music industry.</p>
